The **ApSIC Xbench Connector for Memsource** is now bundled in **ApSIC Xbench 3.0** build 1362 or later. 
It is also strongly recommended that **Memsource Editor** (download from http://www.memsource.com) 
is installed on the machine to instantly fix issues found in ApSIC Xbench.

You can download **ApSIC Xbench 3.0** from the **Download** page at http://www.xbench.net.
