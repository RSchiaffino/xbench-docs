## END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR XBENCH 3.0

By using ApSIC Xbench 3.0 you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms and Conditions"). 

You may make copies of ApSIC Xbench and distribute such copies to others provided that any such recipient has had an opportunity to review and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.   If others within your organization do not have this opportunity to review and agree and you would still like to distribute copies to them, you may do so provided that you have the legal right to bind your organization (and others within your organization) to these Terms and Conditions.  If you do not have this right and the recipients do not have an opportunity to review and agree to these Terms and Conditions, please do not distribute ApSIC Xbench to them.  If you have any questions regarding the terms of distribution, please send an email to info.inbox@xbench.net.

If you have comments on ApSIC Xbench or ideas on how to improve it, please email support.inbox@xbench.net or use the web form that appears on http://www.xbench.net/index.php/support/submit-bug. Please note that by doing so, you also grant ApSIC permission to use and incorporate your ideas or comments into ApSIC Xbench (or other ApSIC S.L. software) without further compensation.

Using ApSIC Xbench 3.0 requires a sign-up process. The Xbench account credentials created during the sign-up will be validated over the Internet with an Xbench authentication server in order to start a licensed instance of Xbench.  The Xbench authentication server will verify your credentials and will determine if your license is valid. Therefore, the authentication process and your license require that you have a working Internet connection.

The licensing model of ApSIC Xbench is based on the purchase of subscription time. You can split your purchased time among as many authorized users as you wish at any given time. Each authorized user is entitled to run one and only one instance of ApSIC Xbench at the same time. ApSIC, S.L. will determine an end of subscription date and time based on your time balance and the number of authorized users. You can add or remove authorized users using the Xbench Control Panel at any time and, upon submitting your changes with the Control panel, ApSIC, S.L. will calculate a new end of subscription date and time.

Also, you need to have at least 1 (one) authorized user defined for each 10 (ten) years of remaining time balance.  If you do not define enough authorized users, the Xbench Control Panel will add placeholders that will deduct time from your time balance as if the place holders were an authorized user.

You acknowledge that, in order to validate your license, one or more authentication servers are required to be operated by ApSIC S.L.  If, for whatever reason, ApSIC S.L. is unable to continue operating the required authentication server or servers and decides to discontinue the subscription license model while you still have subscription balance available, ApSIC S.L. will have at its disposal the following two options as your full and complete compensation for the ceased authentication service: a) Refund you for your remaining subscription time at the time the authentication servers were discontinued, with yearly cost calculated at the average cost per year you paid for your subscription, or b) Convert your subscription license into a permanent license for as many users as the maximum number of authorized users that you have defined during the length of your subscription until the date and time of the conversion into a permanent license.

When you sign up for Xbench, you need to provide your email address. This email address will become your contact email address in case ApSIC S.L. needs to make you aware of a system event affecting your acccount or other significant events related with the performance of ApSIC Xbench functionality.  This email address used in the sign up process will also be considered your primary email address for commercial communications, such as special promotions or significant announcements.  Each time you receive a communication, you will be given the option to opt-out from future commercial announcements.  ApSIC S.L. will not sell or share your email address with any third party.
