The ApSIC Xbench Plugin for SDL Trados Studio 2014 allows you to:

*	From SDL Trados Studio 2014, create an Xbench project 
	automatically gathering information from your current SDL Trados
	Studio 2014 project, and then automatically launch ApSIC Xbench so
	that you can run QA on the files of the project.
*	From ApSIC Xbench, use the **Edit Source** command from the
	**Search** tab or the **QA** tab to open a sdlxliff file in SDL Trados Studio
	right at the segment that is currently selected in Xbench and in the
	SDL Trados Studio project context (connected translation memory
	and termbase).
