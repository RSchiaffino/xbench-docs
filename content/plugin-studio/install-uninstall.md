Before you install the ApSIC Xbench Plugin for SDL Trados Studio
2014, you need to make sure that you have the following software
installed on your machine:

*	**SDL Trados Studio 2014 SP1**. The **Help->About SDL Trados Studio**
	box should show version **11.1.3931** or later.
*	**ApSIC Xbench 3.0 build 1186** or later.

If you do not have these versions, please download and install them
before installing the plugin.

You can download ApSIC Xbench 3.0 and the ApSIC Xbench Plugin for
SDL Trados Studio 2014 from the **Download** page at
http://www.xbench.net. The plugin installable file can be used both with
the 32-bit and the 64.bit editions of ApSIC Xbench 3.0.


## Installing the Plugin

To successfully install the plugin, you need administrative rights. The
plugin will be installed for all SDL Trados Studio users on the machine.
After installing the plugin, you need to run at least once SDL Trados
Studio 2014 as administrator to unpack the plugin. This is especially
important if you install the plugin on a Terminal Server, where there can
be users without administrative rights.

To install the plugin, click the **Setup.Xbench.Plugin.Studio.3.0.n.exe** that is
found in the file you downloaded from http://www.xbench.net, and
follow the installation wizard instructions.


## Uninstalling the Plugin

To uninstall the ApSIC Xbench Plugin for SDL Trados Studio 2014,
simply go to the Windows **Control Panel** and uninstall it.

Please note that you need administrative rights to uninstall the plugin.
