At startup, ApSIC Xbench will look for all DLLs in the ApSIC Xbench directory
with a file name beginning with XbenchQA. Those DLLs implementing all function
calls defined in this reference guide will be loaded and prepared to be used by
the QA process.

To install a QA plug-in, just copy the DLL into the ApSIC Xbench directory. To
uninstall it, simply move the DLL to another directory.
