When the **Internet** tab is the active one, the **Internet** menu has the following menu items:

*	**Open Browser**. Opens the current default browser with the page currently displayed 
	in the **Internet** page. It has the **Ctrl+B** hotkey attached.
*	**Go Back**. Returns to the previous web page. It has the **Alt+Left** hotkey attached.
*	**Go Forward**. Moves to the next page. It has the **Alt+Right** hotkey attached.
*	**Go to URL**. Opens a dialog to go to an specific web page from the **Internet** tab. It has 
	the **Ctrl+U** hotkey attached.
*	**Stop**. Stops loading the current page.
*	**Refresh**. Reloads the current page.
*	**Capture URL**. Captures the current URL and opens the **Capture URL** dialog, 
	where the captured information can be edited before being added to the list of 
	URLs in **Define Links**.
*	**Define Links**. Opens the dialog where you can define Internet links in ApSIC 
	Xbench. For more information, refer to [Settings - Internet]({{< relref "/online-help/dialogs/settings/internet.md" >}}).
*	**Go to \<item>**. Opens the predefined URL. ApSIC Xbench can store any number of 
	predefined URLs. The first 10 entries are assigned the Alt+n key combination, where 
	*n* is a number from 0 to 9. Number 0 corresponds to the 10th entry in the list. 
	ApSIC Xbench also allows accessing these URLs from any Windows application by using the 
	Ctrl+Alt+*n* key combination. In this latter case, the number n should be pressed in the 	
	numeric key pad, when the Num Lock is set. See [Settings - Internet]({{< relref "/online-help/dialogs/settings/internet.md" >}}) to learn how to define predefined URLs.

When a tab other than the **Internet** tab is active, only the **Go to \<items>** menu items are shown.
