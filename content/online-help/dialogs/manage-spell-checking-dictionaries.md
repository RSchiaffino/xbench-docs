This window allows you to install spell-checking dictionaries.

To install a dictionary, select the desired language and click **Install**.

The installed dictionaries will appear with a green ball next to them. If there 
is a newer version of an installed dictionary available, a yellow ball will appear 
next to it. You can click **Update** to download and install the new version. 

To install a dictionary you need administrator rights.
