ApSIC Xbench is an application that, once launched, must be explicitly
shut down when it is no longer needed. In a normal scenario, you will
load your reference project to search for terminology while you are
translating and leave it in the background until you finish your translation
work.

Closing the ApSIC Xbench window does not remove the program
from the memory because it is waiting for your next query with the
**Ctrl+Alt+Insert** key sequence.

## Launching ApSIC Xbench

To launch ApSIC Xbench, follow one of these procedures:

* Choose **Start**->**Programs**->**ApSIC Tools**->**Xbench** on the Windows
task bar.
* Double-click on the icon of a previously defined ApSIC Xbench
project (*.xbp* extension).
* With Windows Explorer, select a file or folder with files supported by ApSIC Xbench, right-click and choose **Run QA in Xbench**.

Xbench can also be launched from other applications, such as Trados Studio using the Xbench plugin, from Chrome using the Xbench Chrome extension, from the Xbench Connector for Memsource, etc.

## Shutting Down ApSIC Xbench

In order to shut down ApSIC Xbench, you have the following options:

* Right-click the ApSIC Xbench icon (a pink gem) located in the
system tray and click **Shut Down Xbench**.
* On the **Project** menu, click **Shut Down Xbench**.
