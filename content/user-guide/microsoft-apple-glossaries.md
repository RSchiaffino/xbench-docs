## Obtaining Microsoft Glossaries

Although Microsoft software glossaries in .csv format were previously publicly available from Microsoft FTP site, at the time of this publication, they are only available though a MSDN subscription available for a fee.

Each language has a separate .zip file that contains all the individual glossaries for the Microsoft products localized into that language. The size of each language file can range from 1 to more than 100 megabytes, which depends on the number of products that are localized by Microsoft into a particular language.

## Obtaining Apple Glossaries

At the time of this publication, the Apple Mac OS X software glossaries are available from the following source if you have an Apple ID:

* http://developer.apple.com/internationalization/downloads/

The glossaries for each language are in Macintosh Disk Image format (extension .dmg). In order to load the Mac OS glossaries into ApSIC Xbench, the .ad or *.lg files contained in these disk images must be extracted. To do so, you can use the UltraISO software (http://www.ezbsystems.com/ultraiso/index.html).
