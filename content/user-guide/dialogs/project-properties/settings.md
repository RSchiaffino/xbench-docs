The **Settings** tab allows you to define project-specific settings including:

**Columns in List**. This field allows you to override the automatic number of columns 
calculated by ApSIC Xbench to another number of columns.

**Auto-Refresh every** *n* **Minutes**. This field allows you to force a refresh of all glossaries 
marked as Auto-Refresh in their properties at the specified time interval. If 0 (zero) is 
specified, no Auto-Refresh is done.

**Show File Name**. When checked, this option shows the file name holding the entry as the last 
column in the list. It is recommended to check this box.

**Show Key Terms at the Top**. When checked, this option forces the creation of the Key Terms priority level, 
which shows its entries before the high priority entries. It is recommended to check this box.
