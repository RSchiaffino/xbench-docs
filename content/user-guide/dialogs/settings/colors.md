The **Colors** tab lets you choose the font colors for the different priorities
and also the background color for zoomed mode. In ApSIC Xbench there are two
modes, overview, where only some relevant entries from each priority are shown,
and the zoomed mode, where all the entries of a given priority are shown. 

This tab allows you to define the following settings:

* **Background color when zoomed**. This is the background color that is used
  in zoomed mode, as a visual indicator that you are not in overview mode 
  (the default mode is overview).
* **Key Terms priority**. This is the color that will be used for entries that
  belong to the Key Terms priority. A glossary is defined as a Key Terms
  glossary in **Project->Properties**.
* **High Priority**. This is the color that will be used for entries belonging
  to the high priority.
* **Medium Priority**. This is the color that will be used for entries
  belonging to the medium priority.
* **Low Priority**. This is the color that will be used for entries belonging
  to the low priority.
* **Tags in list view**. This is the color that will be used for tags in the
  search results list.
* **Background color when nothing found**. This is the background color that
  appears in the search box when no entry is found.
