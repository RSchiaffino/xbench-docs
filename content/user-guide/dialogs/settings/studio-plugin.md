The **Studio Plugin** tab allows you to define settings that modify the behavior of the Xbench plugin for 
SDL Trados Studio. The settings available on this tab are:

*	**Add first local termbase**. When checked, the plugin will add the first local termbase defined for 
	the SDL Trados Studio project to the Xbench QA project created from the plugin. The termbase will be
	assigned high priority in the Xbench project.
*	**Add first local translation memory**. When checked, the plugin will add the first local translation
	memory defined for the SDL Trados Studio project to the Xbench QA project created from the plugin.
	The translation memory will be assigned low priority in the Xbench project.
*	**Use this Xbench project template**. When checked, it will instruct the plugin to add Studio files to
	the Xbench .xbp project indicated in the field below. Use the ellipsis button (**...**) to open a
	Windows Explorer to select the .xbp file.
