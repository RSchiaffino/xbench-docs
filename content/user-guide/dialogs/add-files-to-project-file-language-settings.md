The format selected is a multilingual format, and therefore each term can have more than two languages. 
This window allows you to define the source and target languages that should appear in the Source and 
Target columns of the ApSIC Xbench results for a search.

You can also choose to include in the result lists the terms that are missing either the source or the 
target term. This can be useful to see terms in other languages when you don't have the translated term 
for the language that you are translating, as those translations in other languages can give some additional
context for the source term.
